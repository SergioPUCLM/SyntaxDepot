# SyntaxDepot
A puzzle-solving game for teaching the basic concepts of structured programming.

---

# Summary
The teaching of programming is a constantly evolving field, with multiple tools designed to
facilitate learning fundamental concepts. However, many of these tools offer high flexibility and an
open approach, which can be overwhelming for those without prior experience.
Syntax Depot emerges as a structured and accessible alternative to introduce users to programming
through a gamified environment. It is a puzzle-solving game where players program robots with
different skills and limitations in an automated warehouse to complete tasks such as moving
objects, operating machinery, and avoiding obstacles.
The game uses its own programming language with simplified syntax, allowing players to focus on
structured logic without distractions where players write scripts for robots to execute sequentially,
encouraging logical thinking and optimization.
In addition to its fixed levels, Syntax Depot allows the creation of custom levels dynamically, so
educators can design personalized experiences. Teachers can generate levels that adapt to specific
learning goals, creating flexible objectives and challenges.
This targeted approach, based on concrete objectives, reduces the entry barrier to programming,
offering an intuitive and "on rails" progressive learning experience. Syntax Depot combines
gamification with structured teaching to facilitate the understanding of programming fundamentals
in a practical and entertaining context.

# Objectives
## Main objective
The development of a serious game that facilitates the learning of structured programming through
the solving of logical puzzles with a simplified programming language, where players program
robots to complete specific tasks in an automated warehouse, promoting the development of logical
thinking and solution optimization.

## Secondary objectives
1. Development of the simplified programming language with basic control structures
2. Implementation of the language processor for script execution
3. Design of the game's UI with dynamic sizing
4. Development and implementation of a scoring system for evaluating script complexity
5. Design of a series of levels tailored to the concepts intended to be demonstrated
6. Development of movement mechanics and game execution rules
7. Implementation of dynamic level loading to facilitate the addition of new levels
8. Analysis of other educational tools for teaching programming
9. Study of other serious games focused on programming
