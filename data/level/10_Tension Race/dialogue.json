      "Your tenth task. Double digits. You've officially survived longer than most interns. Congratulations.",
      "And what a treat I have for you today, a maze. A big one. Walls, dead ends, a suspicious number of traps. It's almost nostalgic, like an old arcade cabinet full of ghosts and bad design choices.",
       "Red and Blue are both here. Sorry, no Orange or Pink today. Wait, wrong reference. Both need to reach a charge pad. On opposite ends of this labyrinth. Efficiently and without getting fried.",
      "You won't be learning any new tricks today. This one's all about using what you should already know: loops, conditions, and those barely functioning eyes we call 'see();'.",
      "Careful with the traps, they're scattered all over. And while I'm sure running directly into them is technically a strategy, I wouldn't recommend it.",
      "There's no right path here, just smarter ones. Think ahead. Use logic. And maybe, just maybe, you won't completely embarrass yourself. Or me, I'm supposed to be your instructor after all.",
      "And yes, score still matters. If you're going to meander through the maze like a lost Roomba, do us all a favor and at least make it stylish.",
      "You know the tools. Now show me you can actually use them.",
      "Good luck, Newbie. May your bots dodge sparks and your code be less awful than the last guy's."
