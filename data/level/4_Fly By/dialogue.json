      "Another day, another bot to babysit. This time, it's Green. Why Green? Well, you're not gonna believe this, but it's because it's green. Shocking, I know.",
      "Miss Red already? I know, I know, that little ground-crawler grows on you. Except that he's not little at all.",
      "But now it's Green's time to shine. Or more accurately, to hover ominously.",
      "Unlike Red, Green isn't limited by the tyranny of the floor. If it's not a wall, it can probably float over it.",
      "Pits, crates, shelves, pipes, sleeping bots... none of that slows Green down.",
      "What does slow Green down, you ask? Well, nothing really. Except maybe your coding skills. Oh yeah, and weight. Turns out flying requires a lighter bot.",
      "This means, unlike Red, Green can only move small crates. Big ones will make him crash and burn. Or just crash. No burning, we're not that dramatic here.",
      "Speaking of pits... any warehouse worth its budget has at least one massive, inexplicable chasm. Ours has a lot of them. You'll get to know them, and maybe name them, if you stick around long enough.",
      "Your task is simple: guide Green across this massive gap using the same movement commands as before. No new syntax here, just apply what you've allegedly already learned. Because you have been using loops, right?",
      "Remember: walls are still walls. Try to go through one and Green will protest. Loudly. And by protest, I mean crash spectacularly. So don't do that.",
      "So go on, Newbie. Show me you can bridge the gap, metaphorically, of course. There's no actual bridge. That would've been too easy.",
      "Oh, and before I forget. Remember how Red picked up crates in front of him? Well, because of how Green was designed, his camera is pointing downwards, so you need to hover it over what you want to pick up. Is not a big change, but keep it in mind."
