To add a level, make a folder with the following naming schema:

<x>_<name>

X will not be included and is used so the alphabetical order sorter works properly
The name is what will be displayed

The folder needs to contain the following files:

- structure.json
- bg.png

Structure defines the structure the levels will have and the position the entities start.
BG defines the tilemap. While not required, it will work better if the size of the bg is the (level_width * 64, level_height * 64).

Other folders will be created when needed (DO NOT ADD THEM):
- leaderboard.json
- red.txt
- green.txt
- blue.txt
