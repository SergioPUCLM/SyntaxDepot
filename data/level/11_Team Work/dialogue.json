    "Ah, crate generators. The warehouse's answer to \"we need more busywork\". These hatches will deliver a number of crates up from a lower level for you to handle next.",
    "Red and Green are here today. Their task is simple: move four crates from the generator to the delivery point.",
    "Yes, just four. You'd think we could automate this part. But no, we hired you instead.",
    "The generator will produce crates one at a time. Once picked up, it'll spawn the next. Like magic. Or deeply flawed industrial design.",
    "Now, technically, one bot could do the whole thing. But if you want a better score, and maybe a scrap of my respect, you'll want them to work together.",
    "That means coordination. If both bots rush to grab a crate at the same time, well... someone's going to be disappointed.",
    "Use conditions, use vision, use anything other than pure chaos. I've seen enough pileups at crate stations to last several lifetimes.",
    "You've got the tools. 'see();', loops, logic, whatever it takes to keep these two from stepping on each other's toes. Or treads.",
    "And remember: the goal isn't just to finish. It's to finish well. Let's not make this a comedy routine.",
    "Now go. Move crates. Impress me. Or at the very least, don't embarrass me more than the others."
