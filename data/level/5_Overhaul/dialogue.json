      "Ah. Nothing like the smell of industrial-grade inefficiency in the morning.",
      "Welcome to your first challenge scenario, Newbie. Or not hard, but tedious, like all hauling work. Six crates, one Green bot, and a lovingly absurd amount of structural void.",
      "No, I don't know why the warehouse was built this way. Probably something about airflow. Or drama.",
      "Your task: collect each crate, carefully arranged on the far corners and edges, naturally, and bring them to the central hatch. You know the drill.",
      "You've got everything you need. The real challenge? Doing it without writing a full screenplay.",
      "Green doesn't care about gaps, pipes, or spatial nonsense, lucky for you. Just make sure your logic holds up better than the warehouse architecture.",
      "Also, since your script's about to get... ambitious, here's a gift: comments.",
      "Use // to write inline notes. Anything after it on the same line is ignored by the system. Great for leaving future-you passive-aggressive reminders.",
      "For bigger chunks, use /* and */ to block out multiple lines. You can even use that to temporarily disable parts of your code. Like a safety net, but for logic errors.",
      "You could brute-force this with enough copy-paste... or you could be clever. Impress me. Or at least, avoid embarrassing yourself.",
      "And try not to think too hard about what's at the bottom of that pit. That kind of existential spiral is well above your clearance level."
