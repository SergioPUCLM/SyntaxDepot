    "Look at that. The whole family is here. Red, Green, and yes, even Blue. Don't tell me you forgot Blue. I know functions are hard to grasp, but was it enough to erase a whole friend from your memory? Because it is your friend, right?",
    "Well, they've been charging in the background, emotionally and literally. Time to give them some attention. Hopefully you still remember how read() and write(x) work. You're going to need them.",
    "This time you're not learning something new. You've already got all the toys. Loops, conditions, vision, functions, with and without arguments... If you still feel lost, check the documentation again.",
    "Your job now is to coordinate. Red and Green need to haul some crates as usual. Blue has two terminals to activate. All three have their own goals, but they share the same space. Try not to cause a robot traffic jam.",
    "Writing three scripts at once might feel like a lot, but remember, you've got functions, you can copy and paste them into other robots. Break your code into smaller pieces. Make it clean. Make it readable. Make me proud. Or at least, mildly disappointed instead of outright horrified.",
    "This is the part of the job where you prove you can multitask better than a discount vending machine.",
    "Go on then. Full house, full responsibility. Don't leave Blue behind this time."
