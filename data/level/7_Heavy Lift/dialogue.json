      "Well, well. Look who's finally ready to control two robots at once. I wasn't expecting a family reunion so soon.",
      "I hope all that math with blue didn't make you forget how to handle crates, that is still one of your responsibilities.",
      "This time, however, you won't be alone. You'll have two bots to manage.",
      "Meet the team: you already know Red, it has been a while since you two worked together.",
      "And Green, who continues to defy both gravity and workplace safety protocols.",
      "Today's task is simple: two crates, two bots, one brain. Yours. So... manage accordingly.",
      "The small crate? You'll find it in a place Red can't reach. Good thing Green doesn't care about shelves or common sense.",
      "The large one? That's Red's responsibility. I'd recommend not swapping roles unless you enjoy failure.",
      "Just remember: each bot runs its own code. You're writing separate instructions. Try not to mix them up.",
      "This is your first taste of coordination. Delightful, isn't it? Like herding mechanical cats.",
      "Now go on, Newbie. Show me you can multitask without melting down. If nothing else, maybe the bots will learn to work together better than their human."
