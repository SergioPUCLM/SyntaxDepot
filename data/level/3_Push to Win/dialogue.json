      "Welcome to Sector C, Newbie. You made it. Try not to get sentimental.",
      "Now that the grand journey through corridors is complete, it's time for your very first actual assignment. Lucky you.",
      "See that big square thing one room over? That's a crate. You do know what a crate looks like, right? Don't ask what's inside. We don't pay you to ask questions. Or I guess we do, but not about that.",
      "Your task is simple, Newbie. Get that crate from there and deliver it. Where you ask? Of course, to that hatch over there. The one with the red outline. Once a crate is placed on top, the hatch will open and the crate will be lowered to wherever it is it needs to go.",
      "Red interacts with what's directly in front of it. Not underneath, not behind. Straight ahead. Simple and predictable, just like I like it.",
      "Use 'pickup();' to instruct red to pick up the crate with those big loader arms. You know, the ones that look like they could crush a small car? Yeah, those.",
      "Once Red is standing in front of it with the crate, use 'drop();' to deposit the cargo gently. Or as gently as a 5 ton hunk of metal can manage. It's not a feather, after all.",
      "If Red's not facing the right way, it won't pick up anything. So... aim carefully.",
      "Test your plan, reset if needed, and remember: crates are heavy, but failure is heavier."
