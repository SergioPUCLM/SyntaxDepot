      "Well, this is cozy. Two bots, two charging pads... and one charmingly claustrophobic corridor.",
      "Your goal: get Red and Blue to their respective chargers. Simultaneous docking. Synchronized charging. Robot ballet. Whatever you want to call it.",
      "There's just one problem. The hallway to their destination only fits one at a time, and these bots don't come with turn signals.",
      "Enter the most delightfully useless useful command: wait();",
      "Calling wait(); makes a robot pause for exactly one action, no movement, no turning, no chaos. Just... patience, packaged in parentheses.",
      "You'll need to delay one of them slightly so the other can catch up. Timing is everything.",
      "Technically, you could delay them by spinning in place like a confused office chair, but that would take more time, and more time means a lower score. Efficiency, remember?",
      "Use wait(); where it counts. Less drama, more precision. You shouldn't need more than one or two here anyway.",
      "Alright, let's see if you can line up a perfect robotic duet. And no crashing in the hallway, please. We're still paying off the floor tiles. Even though some tiles look someone stole half of it."
